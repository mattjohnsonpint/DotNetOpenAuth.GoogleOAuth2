DotNetOpenAuth OAuth2 Client for Google  [![NuGet Version](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/DotNetOpenAuth.GoogleOAuth2.svg?style=flat)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/DotNetOpenAuth.GoogleOAuth2/) 
======================================

DNOA and OAuthWebSecurity for ASP.Net MVC 4 ship with only an OpenId provider for Google.
This is an OAuth2 client that you can use instead.

**IMPORTANT** - If you are using ASP.Net MVC 5, this package is not applicable.  You should use [Microsoft.Owin.Security.Google](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Owin.Security.Google) instead.  (It also ships with the MVC 5 starter templates in VS 2013.)  See also [the tutorial here](http://www.asp.net/mvc/tutorials/mvc-5/create-an-aspnet-mvc-5-app-with-facebook-and-google-oauth2-and-openid-sign-on).



## Setup

 1. Setup your Google App using the [Google APIs console](https://code.google.com/apis/console).
    Detailed instructions [here](http://ben.onfabrik.com/posts/oauth-providers#google)

 2. Install this library from [NuGet](https://nuget.org/packages/DotNetOpenAuth.GoogleOAuth2),

        PM> Install-Package DotNetOpenAuth.GoogleOAuth2
 
 ... or download from the [releases page](https://github.com/mj1856/DotNetOpenAuth.GoogleOAuth2/releases) and add a reference
 
 ... or compile from source and add a reference

 3. Register the client instead of the existing Google OpenId client.

 ```csharp
 var client = new GoogleOAuth2Client("yourClientId", "yourClientSecret");
 var extraData = new Dictionary<string, object>();
 OAuthWebSecurity.RegisterClient(client, "Google", extraData);
 ```

## Usage

Just like any other `OAuthWebSecurity` client, except you need one extra hook:

```csharp
// add this line
GoogleOAuth2Client.RewriteRequest();

// it belongs right before your existing call to
OAuthWebSecurity.VerifyAuthentication(....)
```

This is needed because Google requires that any extra querystring parameters for the
redirect be packed into a single parameter called `state`.  Since `OAuthWebSecurity` needs
two parameters, `__provider__` and `__sid__` - we have to rewrite the url.

**Note:** The `RewriteRequest` method will unpack the `state` parameter and place its contents back into the regular querystring.
So if you are looking for a state value such as `ReturnUrl`, you will find it has been moved to `Request.QueryString["ReturnUrl"]`.
